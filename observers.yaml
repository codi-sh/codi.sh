# Observers

The [observers][] package makes it possible to observe changes to arrays and
other collections.
Changes come in three kinds, all of which are meaningful for arrays, some of
which are applicable to other collections and can be implemented by others.

- property changes, including the length of an array
- range changes, from swapping some values at an index for some other values
- map changes, from changing the value at a key or index
